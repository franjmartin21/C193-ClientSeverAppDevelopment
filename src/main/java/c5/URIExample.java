         * - Escapes are not decoded before comparing. http://www.example.com/A and http://www.example.com/%41 are unequal URIs.
         *
         * The hashCode() method is consistent with equals. Equal URIs do have the same hash code and unequal URIs are fairly
         * unlikely to share the same hash code.
