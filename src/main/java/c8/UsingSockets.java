             * Writing to Servers with Sockets
             *
             * Writing to a server is not noticeably harder than reading from one. You simply ask the socket for an output
             * stream as well as an input stream. Although it's possible to send data over the socket using the output stream
             * at the same time you're reading data over the input stream, most protocols are designed so that the client is
             * either reading or writing over a socket, not both at the same time. In the most common pattern, the client
             * sends a request. Then the server responds. The client may send another request, and the server responds again.
             * This continues until one side or the other is done, and closes the connection.
             *
             * One simple bidirectional TCP protocol is dict, defined in RFC 2229. In this protocol, the client opens a socket
             * to port 2628 on the dict server and sends commands such as "DEFINE eng-lat gold". This tells the server to send
             * a definition of the word gold using its English-to-Latin dictionary. (Different servers have different dictionaries
             * installed.) After the first definition is received, the client can ask for another. When it's done it sends the
             * command "quit".
             *
             * DictClient shows how to use that service with Sockets

             * Many protocols, such as finger, whois, and HTTP, begin with the client sending a request to the server, then
             * reading the response. It would be possible to shut down the output after the client has sent the request.
             * For example, this code fragment sends a request to an HTTP server and then shuts down the output, because
