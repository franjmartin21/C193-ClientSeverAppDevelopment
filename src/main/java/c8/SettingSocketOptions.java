     * TCP_NODELAY
     *
     * public void setTcpNoDelay(boolean on) throws SocketException
     * public boolean getTcpNoDelay() throws SocketException
     *
     * Setting TCP_NODELAY to true ensures that packets are sent as quickly as possible regardless of their size. Normally,
     * small (one-byte) packets are combined into larger packets before being sent. Before sending another packet, the local
     * host waits to receive acknowledgment of the previous packet from the remote system. This is known as Nagle's algorithm.
     * The problem with Nagle's algorithm is that if the remote system doesn't send acknowledgments back to the local system
     * fast enough, applications that depend on the steady transfer of small parcels of information may slow down.
     *
     * setTcpNoDelay(true) turns off buffering for the socket. setTcpNoDelay(false) turns it back on. getTcpNoDelay()
     * returns true if buffering is off and false if buffering is on. For example, the following fragment turns off buffering
     * (that is, it turns on TCP_NODELAY) for the socket s if it isn't already off:
     *
     * if (!s.getTcpNoDelay()) s.setTcpNoDelay(true);
     *
     * These two methods are each declared to throw a SocketException, which will happen if the underlying socket implementation
     * doesn't support the TCP_ NODELAY option.

    /**
     * SO_LINGER
     *
     * public void setSoLinger(boolean on, int seconds) throws SocketException
     * public int getSoLinger() throws SocketException
     *
     * The SO_LINGER option specifies what to do with datagrams that have not yet been sent when a socket is closed. By
     * default, the close() method returns immediately; but the system still tries to send any remaining data. If the linger
     * time is set to zero, any unsent packets are thrown away when the socket is closed. If SO_LINGER is turned on and
     * the linger time is any positive value, the close() method blocks while waiting the specified number of seconds
     * for the data to be sent and the acknowledgments to be received. When that number of seconds has passed, the socket
     * is closed and any remaining data is not sent, acknowledgment or no.
     *
     *  These two methods each throw a SocketException if the underlying socket implementation does not support the SO_LINGER
     *  option. The setSoLinger() method can also throw an IllegalArgumentException if you try to set the linger time to a
     *  negative value. However, the getSoLinger() method may return â€“1 to indicate that this option is disabled, and as
     *  much time as is needed is taken to deliver the remaining data; for example, to set the linger timeout for the Socket
     *  s to four minutes, if it's not already set to some other value:
     *
     *  if (s.getTcpSoLinger() == -1) s.setSoLinger(true, 240);
     *
     *  The maximum linger time is 65,535 seconds, and may be smaller on some platforms. Times larger than that will be
     *  reduced to the maximum linger time. Frankly, 65,535 seconds (more than 18 hours) is much longer than you actually
     *  want to wait. Generally, the platform default value is more appropriate.

    /**
     * SO_TIMEOUT
     *
     * public void setSoTimeout(int milliseconds) throws SocketException
     * public int getSoTimeout() throws SocketException
     *
     * Normally when you try to read data from a socket, the read() call blocks as long as necessary to get enough bytes.
     * By setting SO_TIMEOUT, you ensure that the call will not block for more than a fixed number of milliseconds. When
     * the timeout expires, an InterruptedIOException is thrown, and you should be prepared to catch it. However, the socket
     * is still connected. Although this read() call failed, you can try to read from the socket again. The next call may succeed.
     *
     * Timeouts are given in milliseconds. Zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout; it is the default value. For example,
     * to set the timeout value of the Socket object s to 3 minutes if it isn't already set, specify 180,000 milliseconds:
     *
     * if (s.getSoTimeout() == 0) s.setSoTimeout(180000);
     *
     * These two methods each throw a SocketException if the underlying socket implementation does not support the SO_TIMEOUT
     * option. The setSoTimeout() method also throws an IllegalArgumentException if the specified timeout value is negative.

    /**
     * SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF
     *
     * TCP uses buffers to improve network performance. Larger buffers tend to improve performance for reasonably fast
     * (say, 10Mbps and up) connections whereas slower, dial-up connections do better with smaller buffers. Generally,
     * transfers of large, continuous blocks of data, which are common in file transfer protocols such as FTP and HTTP,
     * benefit from large buffers, whereas the smaller transfers of interactive sessions, such as Telnet and many games,
     * do not. Relatively old operating systems designed in the age of small files and slow networks, such as BSD 4.2,
     * use two-kilobyte buffers. Windows XP used 17,520 byte buffers. These days, 128 kilobytes is a common default.
     *
     * Maximum achievable bandwidth equals buffer size divided by latency. For example, on Windows XP suppose the latency
     * between two hosts is half a second (500 ms). Then the bandwidth is 17520 bytes / 0.5 seconds = 35040 bytes / second = 273.75
     * kilobits / second. That's the maximum speed of any socket, regardless of how fast the network is.
     *
     * You can use ping to check the latency to a particular host manually, or you can time a call to InetAddress.isReachable()
     * from inside your program.
     *
     * The SO_RCVBUF option controls the suggested send buffer size used for network input. The SO_SNDBUF option controls
     * the suggested send buffer size used for network output:
     *
     * public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size) throws SocketException, IllegalArgumentException
     * public int getReceiveBufferSize() throws SocketException
     * public void setSendBufferSize(int size) throws SocketException, IllegalArgumentException
     * public int getSendBufferSize() throws SocketException
     *
     * Although it looks like you should be able to set the send and receive buffers independently, the buffer is usually
     * set to the smaller of these two. For instance, if you set the send buffer to 64K and the receive buffer to 128K,
     * you'll have 64K as both the send and receive buffer size. Java will report that the receive buffer is 128K, but
     * the underlying TCP stack will really be using 64K.
     *
     * The setReceiveBufferSize()/setSendBufferSize methods suggest a number of bytes to use for buffering output on this socket.
     * However, the underlying implementation is free to ignore or adjust this suggestion. In particular, Unix and Linux
     * systems often specify a maximum buffer size, typically 64K or 256K, and do not allow any socket to have a larger one.
     * If you attempt to set a larger value, Java will just pin it to the maximum possible buffer size. On Linux, it's not
     * unheard of for the underlying implementation to double the requested size. For example, if you ask for a 64K buffer,
     * you may get a 128K buffer instead.
     *
     * These methods throw an IllegalArgumentException if the argument is less than or equal to zero. Although they're
     * also declared to throw SocketException, they probably won't in practice, because a SocketException is thrown for
     * the same reason as IllegalArgumentException and the check for the IllegalArgumentException is made first.

    /**
     * SO_KEEPALIVE
     *
     * If SO_KEEPALIVE is turned on, the client occasionally sends a data packet over an idle connection (most commonly
     * once every two hours), just to make sure the server hasn't crashed. If the server fails to respond to this packet,
     * the client keeps trying for a little more than 11 minutes until it receives a response. If it doesn't receive a
     * response within 12 minutes, the client closes the socket. Without SO_KEEPALIVE, an inactive client could live more
     * or less forever without noticing that the server had crashed. These methods turn SO_KEEPALIVE on and off and determine

     *
     * public void setKeepAlive(boolean on) throws SocketException
     * public boolean getKeepAlive() throws SocketException

    /**
     * OOBINLINE
     *
     * TCP includes a feature that sends a single byte of "urgent" data out of band. This data is sent immediately. Furthermore,
     * the receiver is notified when the urgent data is received and may elect to process the urgent data before it processes
     * any other data that has already been received. Java supports both sending and receiving such urgent data. The sending
     * method is named, obviously enough, sendUrgentData():
     *
     * public void sendUrgentData(int data) throws IOException
     *
     * This method sends the lowest-order byte of its argument almost immediately. If necessary, any currently cached data
     * is flushed first.
     *
     * How the receiving end responds to urgent data is a little confused, and varies from one platform and API to the next.
     * Some systems receive the urgent data separately from the regular data. However, the more common, more modern approach
     * is to place the urgent data in the regular received data queue in its proper order, tell the application that urgent
     * data is available, and let it hunt through the queue to find it.
     * By default, Java ignores urgent data received from a socket. However, if you want to receive urgent data inline with
     * regular data, you need to set the OOBINLINE option to true using these methods:
     *
     * public void setOOBInline(boolean on) throws SocketException
     * public boolean getOOBInline() throws SocketException
     *
     * The default for OOBINLINE is false. This code fragment turns OOBINLINE on, if it's turned off:
     *
     * if (!s.getOOBInline()) s.setOOBInline(true);
     *
     * Once OOBINLINE is turned on, any urgent data that arrives will be placed on the socket's input stream to be read
     * in the usual way. Java does not distinguish it from nonurgent data. That makes it less than ideally useful, but
     * if you have a particular byte (e.g., a Ctrl-C) that has special meaning to your program and never shows up in the
     * regular data stream, then this would enable you to send it more quickly.

    /**
     * SO_REUSEADDR
     *
     * When a socket is closed, it may not immediately release the local port, especially if a connection was open when
     * the socket was closed. It can sometimes wait for a small amount of time to make sure it receives any lingering
     * packets that were addressed to the port that were still crossing the network when the socket was closed. The system
     * won't do anything with any of the late packets it receives. It just wants to make sure they don't accidentally get
     * fed into a new process that has bound to the same port.
     *
     * This isn't a big problem on a random port, but it can be an issue if the socket has bound to a well-known port because
     * it prevents any other socket from using that port in the meantime. If the SO_REUSEADDR is turned on (it's turned off by default),
     * another socket is allowed to bind to the port even while data may be outstanding for the previous socket.
     *
     * In Java this option is controlled by these two methods:
     *
     * public void setReuseAddress(boolean on) throws SocketException
     * public boolean getReuseAddress() throws SocketException
     *
     * For this to work, setReuseAddress() must be called before the new socket binds to the port. This means the socket
     * must be created in an unconnected state using the noargs constructor; then setReuseAddress(true) is called, and
     * the socket is connected using the connect() method. Both the socket that was previously connected and the new socket
     * reusing the old address must set SO_REUSEADDR to true for it to take effect.

    /**
     * IP_TOS Class of Service
     *
     * Different types of Internet service have different performance needs. For instance, video chat needs relatively high
     * bandwidth and low latency for good performance, whereas email can be passed over low-bandwidth connections and even
     * held up for several hours without major harm. VOIP needs less bandwidth than video but minimum jitter. It might be
     * wise to price the different classes of service differentially so that people won't ask for the highest class of
     * service automatically. After all, if sending an overnight letter cost the same as sending a package via media mail,
     * we'd all just use FedEx overnight, which would quickly become congested and overwhelmed. The Internet is no different.
     *
     * The class of service is stored in an eight-bit field called IP_TOS in the IP header. Java lets you inspect and
     * set the value a socket places in this field using these two methods:
     *
     * public int getTrafficClass() throws SocketException
     * public void setTrafficClass(int trafficClass) throws SocketException
     *
     * The traffic class is given as an int between 0 and 255. Because this value is copied to an eight-bit field in the
     * TCP header, only the low order byte of this int is used; and values outside this range cause IllegalArgumentExceptions.
     *
     * In 21st-century TCP stacks, the high-order six bits of this byte contain a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
     * value and the low-order two bits contain an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) value. The DSCP thus has room
     * for up to 26 different traffic classes. However, it's up to individual networks and routers to specify exactly what
     * the 64 different possible DSCP values mean. The four values shown in Table 8-1 are fairly common.
     *
     * Common DSCP values and interpretations
